    '''Main class container for stochastic events
    
    (inherits from Event)
    
    Define here all base settings that all stochastic events can share, 
    according also to the defined shared attributes in events.Event
    e.g.:
    - type of parameters that can change (several events share the same base settings)
    - pdfs assigned to these parameters
    - uncertainty of position itself? If so: with which other event can it be swapped?
